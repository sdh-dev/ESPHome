# In this mode, turning the external switch ON will cause the relay to stay ON for a set period of time
# Turning the external switch OFF will wait a short period of time, then turn the relay OFF
# This will preserve the orientation of the external switch (ON is on, OFF is off), but it may be confusing if you
#   come to the switch in the ON position after it has timed out (relay is OFF). 
#   You will have to turn the switch OFF, then ON again to trigger a new timed period of running.
# There is an immediate switch mode that is available to the automation
